## Project Name: XR CLASS

## Project Description: 
We have developed a VR app that caters the education system of shcools and colleges, fullfilling the lack of visualization of complex topics. In this project, we have developed custom labs for certain topics for Biology and Chemistry for school students. We aim to popularize AR/VR education in tier-2 and tier-3 cities by making it affordable.

## Purpose: 
The puporse of the project is to make the understanding of complex topics easier through comprehensive VR labs. Students will be able to understand complex topics like the Solid State or components of heart very easily. They will be able to interact with the application, thus making studying fun, interactive and affordable.

## Features:
- **Custom VR Labs:**
  - Developed custom labs for specific topics in Biology and Chemistry.
  - Tailored content to match the curriculum of schools and colleges.

- **Interactive Learning:**
  - Provides an immersive learning experience through Virtual Reality.
  - Allows students to interact with 3D models and simulations, enhancing understanding.

- **Topic Coverage:**
  - Covers complex topics such as Solid State in Chemistry or detailed components of the heart in Biology.
  - Aims to address challenging subjects that may require visualization for better comprehension.

- **Comprehensive Content:**
  - Includes detailed explanations, annotations, and visual representations of concepts.
  - Offers a comprehensive understanding of each topic.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive interface designed for students of various age groups.
  - Easy navigation for a seamless learning experience.

- **Fun and Engaging:**
  - Makes studying enjoyable through gamified elements and interactive activities.
  - Encourages participation and active involvement in the learning process.
- **Affordable:**
- The whole application only requrires only Rs. 2000 to experience
- better than occulus in terms of affordability.

## How XR class Addresses Future Challenges?

The challenges that can arrive in future are scalability and other business related issues. We have a foolproof business plan to tackle the challenges.

## Business Plan

For scaling this idea from just a mere project to actual business, we need to hire a team and take up contracts from different instituions to build them up custom VR labs. In Our case, the institutions shall be schools and colleges. 

## Revenue
We shall take up orders from a certain institutions and charge thema monthly retainer for our custojm VR classes. This shall bring in regular money to the firm.
